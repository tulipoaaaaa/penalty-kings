# Penalty Kings

[![Penalty Kings in 15 seconds: the cold-open top-bin goal, a shot off the post, a Golden Boot ball reveal, then 3, 5 and 10 goals in a row](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tulipoaaaaa/penalty-kings/HEAD/docs/media/money-shot.gif)](https://github.com/tulipoaaaaa/penalty-kings/blob/HEAD/docs/media/money-shot.webm)

*15 s of real play, recorded at full motion in the SDK preview (simulated economy): cold-open goal → off the post → Golden Boot reveal (the demo pins that roll; the real odds are 1%) → 3, 5 and 10 in a row.*

Your hardwired Rare Friend is the striker in a pixel-art football game. You swipe to shoot
penalties and free kicks against 12 original keepers. In the Big Match you open packs of balls
bought with $RAREFRIENDS; each ball's rarity comes from on-chain randomness and sets its RF value.

**One sentence:** Penalty Kings makes your Rare Friend the striker in a skill-based pixel-art
shootout. The optional Big Match sells packs of balls for RF whose rarity is decided by
on-chain randomness, and every ball is backed by RF and redeemable.

## Pilot with Rare Friends

Penalty Kings is a **pilot being adapted by Rare Friends to FriendSDK v0.2.1**. Rare Friends will
fork the repo and deploy its own prototype contracts for the game's **two random rolls**:
- **Roll 1, buying a pack:** the rarity of each ball.
- **Roll 2, taking a penalty:** the shot is **committed first**; the random value then seeds only the keeper's dive.

SDK v0.2.1 brings Google sign-up, embedded wallets, a loaned Friend, Apple/Google Pay and a managed
backend. So the game keeps only a thin adapter with marked integration points (progress storage and
the random beacon). The pilot ships **without $GBOOT**; the token design stays a tested, undeployed
upgrade package. The architecture, entry points and data formats are in
[docs/RNG-INTEGRATION.md](https://github.com/tulipoaaaaa/penalty-kings/blob/HEAD/docs/RNG-INTEGRATION.md)
and [docs/HANDOFF-RF.md](https://github.com/tulipoaaaaa/penalty-kings/blob/HEAD/docs/HANDOFF-RF.md).

**Designed for a ~15-second random beacon.** Waiting up to 15 s for randomness should feel like
suspense, not lag:
- **Pack reveal:** the sealed pack shakes and glows more as the wait goes on, then the balls reveal from lowest to highest, with a building sting before the best one.
- **Penalty:** the ball warms up on the spot, the keeper plays mind games, the crowd drumrolls, the stadium hushes, then the payoff.

Short waits skip straight to the payoff, so instant randomness stays as fast as today (release → result ≤ 1.2 s, asserted in CI).

## Play

### Judge path (60 s)

**Video (59 s):** [docs/media/judge-path.webm](https://github.com/tulipoaaaaa/penalty-kings/blob/HEAD/docs/media/judge-path.webm).
It was recorded in the SDK's own test harness (mock wallet, SDK sample Friend #7730, full motion),
so the economy in it is **SIMULATED**, the same as in the preview.

1. **Title:** watch the cold-open showreel for a few seconds, then **Skip intro ▸** → **Kick off**.
2. **Tutorial:** 3 swipes up from the ball. Your first goal gets the big celebration and a crowd wave.
3. **Modes:** the **NEXT GOAL** line always points at a free unlock (here, today's Daily Challenge).
4. **Free Kicks:** 2 kicks over the wall (curl the swipe to bend it). Then **Menu → Change mode**.
5. **Big Match:** **Ball shop** (odds printed on the pack) → buy a 2-ball pack → **Open** →
   **Reveal all** (true totals: spent, pulled, net) → **Go to my Bag** → choose a ball.
6. **Kick** with your chosen ball; the HUD shows your Bag (balls are not used up by kicking).

No wallet? The [free practice page](https://tulipoaaaaa.github.io/penalty-kings/practice/) plays
without one ([screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tulipoaaaaa/penalty-kings/HEAD/docs/screenshots/practice-844x390-kick.png)).
The video and the `judge-*.png` frames are regenerated only by `npm run record:judge`, not by CI.

**Playable preview (simulated economy):** https://tulipoaaaaa.github.io/penalty-kings/
(Pro stadium: `/pro/` · Champions: `/champions/`)

**Free practice, no wallet needed:** https://tulipoaaaaa.github.io/penalty-kings/practice/.
Anyone can take a few practice kicks against the keepers (no wallet, no Friend art, no economy),
then "Get your Friend to play for real".

The preview requires a browser wallet on **Robinhood mainnet (4663)** holding a **hardwired Rare
Friends Generations NFT (generation ≥ 1)**. The SDK's real wallet connection and ownership gate
run before play. The preview needs no RF, signature or transaction; every purchase and reward
in it is **SIMULATED** and labelled.

**Controls**
- **Touch / mouse:** swipe up from the ball. Where you release aims the shot and the reticle
  shows the landing point; speed sets the pace; bending the swipe curls the ball.
- **Keyboard:** arrow keys aim, A / D curl, W / S topspin (free kicks), hold **Space** to charge and
  release to shoot.
- **Quick shot** button; **Menu** (Bag, Ball shop, Cups, Scouting Book, Rules, Settings).
- **Settings:** mute, reduced motion, haptics. The game pauses whenever the runtime menu is open.

**Free modes (skill only, no RF):**
- tutorial (3 coached kicks);
- Penalties against a ladder of 12 keepers, each with a stamp in the Scouting Book;
- Free Kicks: a wall, wind, curl and knuckleballs, with wall heights by stadium;
- Target Practice: 60 s, combos, crossbar bonus;
- World Tour: 30 data-driven levels with 3-star objectives;
- Daily Challenge: the same scenario for everyone that day.

A difficulty director keeps goal rates in a 55–65% band.

**Big Match (optional, RF):**
1. **Buy** a pack of 1 / 2 / 5 / 10 balls.
2. **Open** it (the SDK `play` + `settle`).
3. **Reveal** the balls one by one or all at once. You see the true totals: spent, pulled, net.
4. Keep the balls in your **Bag**, which tracks each ball's kicks, goals and top bins, your lucky ball, editions, and an S0 discontinued sample.
5. **Choose** a ball to kick. Choosing changes only the score multiplier, trail and commentary. It never changes rarity, RF value, odds or prizes, and balls are not used up by kicking.
6. **Redeem** any ball for its RF value at any time.

> **Your kick never changes what you win: ball rarity is decided by on-chain randomness.
> Skill is for glory, streaks, stars and the leaderboard.**

| Ball | Chance | RF value (× price) | Park (10 RF) | Pro (1,000 RF) | Champions (10,000 RF) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Scuffed | 31.5% | 0 | 0 RF | 0 RF | 0 RF |
| Training | 27% | 0.5 | 5 RF | 500 RF | 5,000 RF |
| Match | 20% | 1 | 10 RF | 1,000 RF | 10,000 RF |
| Pro | 11% | 1.5 | 15 RF | 1,500 RF | 15,000 RF |
| Silver | 7% | 2.5 | 25 RF | 2,500 RF | 25,000 RF |
| Gold | 2.5% | 5 | 50 RF | 5,000 RF | 50,000 RF |
| Golden Boot | 1% | 10 | 100 RF | 10,000 RF | 100,000 RF |

- The expected RF return is **exactly 90.00%** in every stadium, asserted in CI. Every ball
  reserves the top prize until it settles.
- USD figures convert with the real RF price from the RF/WETH and WETH/USDG Uniswap v4 pools on
  4663. In the SDK preview this is a labelled on-chain snapshot, because the preview may only
  read the game contract. Live stadiums read the price every 60 s and show "—" on failure.

## $GBOOT (not in the pilot: a tested, undeployed upgrade)

The pilot ships without $GBOOT. The upgrade package is kept for later:
- a 100M fixed-supply token paired with RF;
- the 10% edge split 40% RF burn / 30% $GBOOT buy-back and burn / 30% Golden Boot Cup;
- sinks: the Skill Cup, Wildcards, cosmetics;
- farm-proofed rewards: at most 2 RF-equivalent per entry and 3 per day;
- a free-price, RF-backed ball market (BallVault).

It is covered by Foundry unit, fuzz, invariant and mainnet-fork tests. The owner approved it as a **design only**; the recorded defaults (a plain pool with a 1% LP fee and no hook until audited, whose fees are split 50% burned / 50% to the Cup pot; a proposed season-0 bootstrap, what the perk tiers mean) are in
[docs/GBOOT-UPGRADE.md](https://github.com/tulipoaaaaa/penalty-kings/blob/HEAD/docs/GBOOT-UPGRADE.md),
and the full maths is in [docs/ECONOMY.md](https://github.com/tulipoaaaaa/penalty-kings/blob/HEAD/docs/ECONOMY.md).

## What is live, simulated, and roadmap

- **Live on-chain (Robinhood 4663):** only the builder burner's Friend **#336583 hardwired at Gen
  2**, [tx 0xd6a6a8b9…c78d0](https://robinhoodchain.blockscout.com/tx/0xd6a6a8b911e7a7eba8b5e5771a4ad17ed3fe3af785a1b7e16e0640e86acc78d0).
  No game contract, $GBOOT or pool is deployed, and none will be deployed from this repo: Rare
  Friends deploys the pilot's contracts.
- **Simulated (preview):** the RF balance (20 RF, the SDK default), packs, reveals, rewards, Cup
  pots, race tables and rivals. The beacon wait is simulated in the Showroom (0 / 5 / 15 s).
- **Roadmap:**
  - the Rare Friends SDK v0.2.1 pilot (sign-up, wallets, loaned Friends, payments and the backend come from the SDK);
  - the two random rolls on Rare Friends' contracts;
  - saved progress on the SDK backend;
  - the live Skill Cup referee;
  - later, the $GBOOT upgrade after an audit and legal review.

npm run build:site   # static site in site/ (Park /, Pro /pro/, Champions /champions/, practice /practice/)
```

## Checks, credits and limitations

**Checks** (in GitHub Actions; the preview only redeploys after a fully green CI run):
- `friendsdk check` + the SDK browser harness at 960 px and 360 px, and typecheck;
- engine tests (31): zones, keepers, the difficulty director, the swipe mapping regression table,
  free-kick physics;
- game-logic tests (86): levels, progress, daily, target, the reveal ethics rule, prizes, the
  live-price maths, pitch geometry, Bag honesty, and an action-flow state machine covering every
  action in ≈69k states;
- browser tests:
  - the buy → open → reveal → Bag → kick → redeem flow;
  - every free mode;
  - a 17-scenario action-flow audit: double release, key plus mouse, walkout, pack reveal, resize mid-swipe, 2 s and 5 s randomness waits, and speed (release → result ≤ 1.2 s);
  - phone layouts at 360×800, 390×844, 800×360 and 844×390, and the free practice page (no wallet or RPC requests);
  - 90-second first-session QA;
- odds verification (EV 90.00%); the economy simulator; the Skill Cup referee (replay match, signed results);
- Foundry: 169 unit, fuzz and invariant tests, including the tokenomics v2 vaults, the Bootroom farm bound, the rewards budget invariant, the TWAP oracle
  and BallVault solvency invariants, plus mainnet-fork tests;
- a real mainnet ownership-gate test; the secret scan.

**Known issues and limitations:**
- **Saved progress:** the SDK v0.1.2 sandbox has no storage, so the preview offers a **save code**
  in Settings. Durable progress comes from the SDK v0.2.1 backend (the integration point is already
  in the code).
- The preview wallet holds 20 simulated RF, which buys a 2-ball Park pack.
- Browser tests use the SDK's mocked wallet; a human real-wallet playthrough is recommended.
- **Risks:** live mode would use real RF. Paid chance with a redeemable prize needs legal review
  before any live promotion (an 18+ gate and region notices are planned). Official production
  publication needs Rare Friends review.

**Assets:** all art is original and drawn in code:
- the pitch, the three stadiums, crowd, goal and wall;
- 12 keepers;
- ball sprites per rarity.

The Friend is its canonical on-chain Generations sprite (FriendSDK sprite reader), unaltered. The
crowd of little Friends reuses the player's own sprite (downscaled nearest-neighbour, pixels
unaltered, props held around it); no other Friend's art is read.
UI sounds come from the FriendSDK sound kit; crowd, kick and music are synthesised in code. No
real clubs, crests, players or brands appear.
